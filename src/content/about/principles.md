These principles shape how we make decisions and collaborate as a community.

## Diversity

As a group inspired by biodiversity, we naturally celebrate human diversity in all its forms. We believe that the most meaningful science grows from bringing together different perspectives, experiences, and voices. We’re dedicated to maintaining an inclusive environment where everyone—regardless of race, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical or intellectual ability, health status, pregnancy, or background—feels welcome and valued.

## Fair Collaboration

We recognize that science exists within broader social and political systems and that imbalances of power can shape how research is done. Our commitment is to nurture collaborations that are equitable, respectful, and long-lasting—partnerships that enrich everyone involved. We advocate for fair access to opportunities and shared resources, ensuring all contributors can engage meaningfully in every part of the scientific journey, independent of institutional prestige, funding, or career incentives.

## Open-science

We actively support openness at every stage of the scientific process. Our community promotes open data, open code, and open models as essential pathways to transparency and collective progress. At the same time, we value proper credit for the individuals and groups who create and share these resources. We believe that knowledge should flow freely for the benefit of all, strengthening our shared capacity to protect and understand the natural world.
