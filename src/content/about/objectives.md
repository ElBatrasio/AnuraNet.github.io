## To Build and Promote Open Standards.

We work together to create and encourage open, accessible ways of sharing acoustic data and annotations. By developing best practices as a community, we ensure our collective efforts are easy to share, reuse, and build upon—supporting transparency, collaboration, and progress in research and conservation worldwide.

## To Grow and Share AI Tools for All.

We aim to be a space where people can come together to co-develop, exchange, and discuss open-source AI tools for bat acoustic monitoring. Through the open sharing of code, models, and knowledge, we hope to inspire innovation and make powerful tools available to everyone interested in protecting and studying bats.

## To Facilitate Access to Knowledge.

We seek to create inclusive spaces where anyone—scientists and non-scientists alike—can learn, share opinions, and engage with the latest developments from our community. By opening doors to participation, we encourage dialogue, curiosity, and collective growth.
