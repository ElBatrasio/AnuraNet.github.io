## To build a standardized, universal guide

We aim to establish a common framework for anuran acoustic monitoring that can be applied across research groups and geographic regions. Through a standardized protocol for data acquisition, recording, annotation and analysis, we seek to ensure that datasets are consistent, interoperable, and reusable, creating a shared and practical language among researchers worldwide.

## To create an open access platform and network

We are committed to making anuran acoustic data easily discoverable and freely accessible. By using and developing open-source AI tools and promoting the exchange of code and models, we aim to foster collaboration across research projects and reduce barriers within the scientific community.

## To develop powerful, innovative AI tools

We strive to advance and apply Artificial Intelligence in support of the study and conservation of anuran species. By harnessing AI’s capacity for automatic, rapid, and accurate processing of large and diverse datasets, we aim to support precise, evidence-based decision making in research and conservation.

## To promote community accessibility and participation

We envision an inclusive community where scientists, conservation practitioners, and citizens can learn, contribute, and collaborate. By providing accessible resources and openly sharing tools and information, we encourage dialogue, curiosity, and active participation in knowledge generation and conservation efforts.
